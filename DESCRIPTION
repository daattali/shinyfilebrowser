Description: Display a simple file browser of the server-side file system in
    'Shiny' apps. The file browser also supported "fake" file systems by
    allowing you to browse any set of arbitrary paths, effectively allowing
    you to navigate a tree structure. Finally, a list selector is also
    available, allowing a user to select an item from a list.
